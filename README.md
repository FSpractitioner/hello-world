I like Mr.Robot very much . It is the best TV play I have saw.
Maybe I can't become Elliot in technology forever, but I will try .
Mr.Robot is cool . There is a Mr.Robot in everyone's mind. It just like 
day and night, light and dark, yin and yang . we all possess kind and 
evil , but the evil was buried in the mind deeply by us.

This just my opinion , everyone has themselves feeling . OK, actually , 
this just a test file
